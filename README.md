# Deck of Cards

Page wich draws 1 card per second from a deck and keeps drawing cards from the deck until it has drawn a **QUEEN** of every suit. Once all **QUEENS** are drawns, shows the cards in the following way:

- All of the cards that were drawn for each suit are sort by value (Aces are high)
 Example: Hearts: [2, 3, 7, Jack, Queen].
